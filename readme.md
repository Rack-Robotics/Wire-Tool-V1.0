# Wire Tool V1.0 

The Wire Tool V1.0 is an open-source wire EDM (electrical discharge machining) toolhead released by Rack Robotics. It aims to provide a cost-effective, easily replicable solution for wire EDM enthusiasts and professionals. This project includes detailed CAD and files for 3D printing. This tool is was optimized for the [Powercore V2.0](https://github.com/Rack-Robotics/Powercore-V2.0/tree/master). 

This project is open-source, to encourage collaboration and innovation within the wire EDM community.

## Best Practices

## Safety 

**DANGER** The Powercore operates at a potentially hazardous voltage of 65 - 72 VDC, and supplies high-power waveforms

The Wire Tool V2.0 is intended to be used in combination with the Powercore V2.0 EDM power supply. Improper use of the Powercore can increase radiated emission levels. These intrinsic properties of EDM necessitate operator care and supervision. Touching the workpiece or electrode(s) during EDM operation exposes the may expose the user to 65 - 72 VDC high-voltage. Individuals with pacemakers or similar medical devices should not operate the Powercore, as the high-voltage environment could interfere with their functionality. Ensure that proper measures are taken against EMI. Routing of EDM power through unshielded/twisted cables not recommended. Unshielded/twisted cables function as antennas, which will radiate emissions into the nearby environment.
